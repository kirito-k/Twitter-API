# Twitter-API
## Instructions:
This is a starters guide for someone who is about to start coding with Twitter's API.

We will be using Tweepy, Twitter's API wrapper. API wrappers allows us to perform API calls without worrying about
all complexities underneath the call.

## Requirements
- Install Tweepy using 
```
pip install tweepy
```

## Implementation
1. Clone the repository.
2. From your newly created App on Twitter API Apps page, copy the keys and paste them into relevant sections of the
'config.JSON' file. Creating a config file is a good way to avoid having the authentication keys directly inside main code.
3. Run the main code
```
python twitterAPI.py
```
